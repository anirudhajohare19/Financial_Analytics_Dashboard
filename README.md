## Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing financial data to support strategic decision-making in:
1. **Investment Planning** – Analyzing market cap, ROI, EPS, and macroeconomic trends.
2. **Risk Management** – Evaluating debt ratios, liquidity, and credit ratings.
3. **Strategic Planning** – Assessing revenue, expenses, profit margins, and currency exchange fluctuations.

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and data-driven insights to enhance financial decision-making.

## Objectives
